Java-Engine
===========

This is my simple java game engine.

It uses some swing for the components and then the usaual java.awt stuff, so mainly boilerplate code.
I was inspired by the slick2d engine, but wanted more control, for instance for Mac OS X fullscreen support.

I will work on this everytime a game I'm making needs more basic stuff.
